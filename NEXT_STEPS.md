# Next Steps for helm-release

This document summarizes the changes made to enable Homebrew distribution and CI/CD for the helm-release tool, and outlines the next steps to complete the setup.

## Changes Made

1. **Version Information**
   - Added Version variable to cmd/root.go
   - Updated Makefile to include version in build

2. **CI/CD Setup**
   - Created GitHub Actions workflows:
     - `.github/workflows/build.yml` for building and testing
     - `.github/workflows/release.yml` for creating releases and updating Homebrew formula
   - Added GoReleaser configuration (`.goreleaser.yml`)

3. **Documentation**
   - Updated README.md with Homebrew installation instructions
   - Created CHANGELOG.md for tracking changes
   - Created HOMEBREW_TAP_SETUP.md with instructions for setting up the Homebrew tap
   - Created RELEASE_PROCESS.md with instructions for creating releases
   - Created HOMEBREW_USAGE.md with instructions for using helm-release with Homebrew
   - Created CI_CD_DETAILS.md with detailed information about the CI/CD pipeline

4. **Templates**
   - Created homebrew-formula-template.rb for the Homebrew formula

## Next Steps

To complete the setup, follow these steps:

1. **Create the Homebrew Tap Repository**
   - Follow the instructions in HOMEBREW_TAP_SETUP.md to create the homebrew-tap repository
   - Add the initial formula using the template in homebrew-formula-template.rb

2. **Set Up GitHub Secrets**
   - Create a Personal Access Token with repo scope
   - Add it as a secret named HOMEBREW_TAP_TOKEN in the helm-release repository

3. **Create the First Release**
   - Follow the instructions in RELEASE_PROCESS.md to create the first release
   - This will trigger the release workflow, which will:
     - Build the binaries
     - Create a GitHub release
     - Update the Homebrew formula

4. **Test the Homebrew Installation**
   - Follow the instructions in HOMEBREW_USAGE.md to install helm-release via Homebrew
   - Verify that the installation works correctly

5. **Future Development**
   - Use the CI/CD pipeline for future releases
   - Update the CHANGELOG.md for each release
   - Consider adding more tests and improving code coverage

## Additional Considerations

1. **Cross-Platform Testing**
   - Consider expanding the CI/CD pipeline to test on multiple platforms (Linux, macOS, Windows)

2. **Code Coverage**
   - Add code coverage reporting to the CI/CD pipeline

3. **Documentation**
   - Keep the documentation up to date with new features and changes

4. **Other Package Managers**
   - Consider adding support for other package managers (apt, yum, Scoop, etc.)
